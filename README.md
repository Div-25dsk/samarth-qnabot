# Project Samarth – Intelligent Q&A System for Agricultural Data

Project Samarth is a simple question–answering system that lets users ask
questions about agricultural data such as crop production and irrigation. The system uses Python for analysis and Streamlit for the user
interface.

---

##  What This Project Does

- Lets users type a natural-language question  
- Processes and understands the question  
- Searches the agricultural dataset  
- Returns a clear answer (highest crop, summary, comparisons, etc.)  
- Shows basic visualisations (where applicable)

##  What I Learned (Optional but Good for GitHub)

- How to clean and analyse public datasets  
- How to build a simple Q&A logic in Python  
- How to create a Streamlit interface  
- How to integrate different parts of a project  

---

##  Notes

- This project is for learning and demonstration.
- The dataset is not included in the repo (because GitHub storage is limited).
